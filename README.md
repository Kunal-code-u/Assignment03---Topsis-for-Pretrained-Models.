# TOPSIS-Based Evaluation of Pre-Trained Models for Text Classification

## Overview
This project applies the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method to evaluate and rank pre-trained transformer models for **IMDB Sentiment Classification**. The evaluation considers multiple performance metrics and selects the best model based on a weighted decision-making approach.

## Dataset
- **IMDB Sentiment Analysis Dataset** (from Hugging Face `datasets` library)
- Contains **movie reviews** labeled as **positive (1)** or **negative (0)**
- The dataset is **tokenized** using the `bert-base-uncased` tokenizer.
- Training set size: **1000 samples**
- Test set size: **200 samples**

## Models Evaluated
The following **pre-trained transformer models** are evaluated:

| Model     | Hugging Face Model Name |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **BERT**       | `bert-base-uncased`   |
| **RoBERTa**    | `roberta-base`        |
| **DistilBERT** | `distilbert-base-uncased` |
| **ALBERT**     | `albert-base-v2` |

## Metrics Used
The models are evaluated based on the following performance metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**
- **Inference Time (Placeholder)**
- **Model Size (Placeholder)**

## TOPSIS Method
TOPSIS is used to rank the models based on the above metrics. The criteria are weighted as follows:

| Metric        | Weight |
|--------------|--------|
| Accuracy     | 0.30   |
| Precision    | 0.20   |
| Recall       | 0.20   |
| F1-score     | 0.20   |
| Inference Time | 0.05   |
| Model Size   | 0.05   |

### Steps:
1. **Dataset Loading & Tokenization**
2. **Fine-Tuning & Evaluation of Pre-Trained Models**
3. **Normalization & Weighting of Evaluation Metrics**
4. **Computing Ideal Best and Worst Values**
5. **Calculating TOPSIS Score & Ranking Models**
6. **Visualizing Results with a Bar Chart**

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib transformers datasets scikit-learn torch
```

### Running the Script
Execute the following command:
```bash
python 102216002_Topsis for Pretrained Models.
```

### Expected Output
1. **Table of Model Rankings** (Example Output):
```bash
       Model  TOPSIS Score  Rank
0      BERT       0.7823     1
1  RoBERTa       0.7651     2
2  ALBERT       0.7486     3
3  DistilBERT       0.7204     4
```
2. **Bar Chart Visualization of Model Rankings**

## Results Interpretation
- **Higher TOPSIS score** indicates **better overall performance**.
- **Accuracy & F1-score** have the highest weights, influencing rankings the most.
- **Inference time & model size** have a minor impact due to their lower weights.
